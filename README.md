# codespace-project
This codespace project is for testing apps that isn't working as exptected.

1. The primary use is for reference, when I write an issue on packages with issues.
2. There will be a published version of this app, deployd on https://codespace-project.vercel.app

All projects will get their own branch, and then be merged into the main branch.

The purpose of creating a unique branch for each test is that it is possible to create a branch from the commit.

If the test project gets overwritten by new test project, I can go back and look for the branch and rebuild it.
